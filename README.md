# text/template ‚Üù JavaScript

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/fatlotus/tmpl2js/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/fatlotus/tmpl2js)

The `tmpl2js` package compiles Golang templates (from the `text/template`
package) into executable JavaScript. This way, developers can build responsive
applications (with dynamic, partial page updates), without writing much
JavaScript.

This code is intentionally structured as a library, to make it easier to embed
in your own work.

## Example

```go
