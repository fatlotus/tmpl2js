# text/template ‚Üù JavaScript

The `tmpl2js` package compiles Golang templates (from the `text/template`
package) into executable JavaScript. This way, developers can build responsive
applications (with dynamic, partial page updates), without writing much
JavaScript.

This code is intentionally structured as a library, to make it easier to embed
in your own work.
